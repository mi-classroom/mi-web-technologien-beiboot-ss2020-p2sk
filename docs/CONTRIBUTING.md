# Contributing

First of all, thank you very much to start contributing to this project. Before you start, please read through this guide.

## Code of Conduct

To build a strong and healthy community from the startup, I decided to add the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## Design decisions

This projects uses [ADR](https://adr.github.io/) to track all the decisions made. You can read up the decision by visiting the [ADR Index](adr/index.md).

## Styleguides for Go Code

When contributing also be familiar with [How to effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and addiotionaly the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments). Beside of this, Go uses [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) to format the Go code. If your IDE doesn't support this feature automatically like [Go for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) please format your code after completion.
